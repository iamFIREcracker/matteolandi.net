    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
    My life as a developer is a mess: at work I have a laptop with Windows 7 and Cygwin installed; I also have a Vagrant box, running Ubuntu, that I use to do the most of my development work.  At home I have a Macbook Air, with Mac OS Sierra.
    </p>

    <p>
    I have been a Vim user for years, but only recently I discovered the <code>:Gbrowse</code> command from the awesome <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive" alt="vim-fugitive">vim-fugitive</a> -- but of course it wasn't working from within a remote session as which browser should it try to open the URL with?
    </p>

    <p>
    Wouldn't it be nice if I could read from the OS clipboard, or write to it, using a single command line tool? And wouldn't it awesome if the same tool worked on various operating systems? (at least the ones I use on a daily basis)
    </p>

    <p>
    I had already built <a href="./cb.html" alt="cb">cb</a> in the past, so I thought maybe I can re-use some if it and build something that would make <code>:Gbrowse</code> work fine, even when working remotely.
    </p>

    <p>
    <em>enters <code>br</code>..</em>
    </p>

    <h2>Hands-on</h2>
    <span>Open a URL from the command line</span>
    <pre>
      <code>
&gt; br https://google.com
// opens URL with your default browser
      </code>
    </pre>
    <span>It works remotely too!</span>
    <pre>
      <code>
&gt; br --listen &amp;
&gt; ssh -R 5557:localhost:5557 user@remote
remote&gt; br https://google.com
// opens URL with your default browser...on the host machine!
      </code>
    </pre>
