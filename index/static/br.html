      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
      My life as a developer is a mess: at work I have a laptop with Windows
      7 and Cygwin installed; I also have a Vagrant box, running Ubuntu, that
      I use to do the most of my development work.  At home I have a Macbook
      Air, with Mac OS Sierra.
      </p>

      <p>
      I have been a Vim user for years, but only recently I discovered the
      <code>:Gbrowse</code> command from the awesome
      <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive" alt="vim-fugitive">vim-fugitive</a>
      -- but of course it wasn't working from within a remote session as which
      browser should it try to open the URL with?
      </p>

      <p>
      Wouldn't it be nice if I could read from the OS clipboard, or write to it,
      using a single command line tool? And wouldn't it awesome if the same tool
      worked on various operating systems? (at least the ones I use on a daily basis)
      </p>

      <p>
      I had already built
      <a href="./cb.html" alt="cb">cb</a> in the
      past, so I thought maybe I can re-use some if it and build something that
      would make <code>:Gbrowse</code> work fine, even when working remotely.
