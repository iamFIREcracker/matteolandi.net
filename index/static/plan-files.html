      <h1>.plan files</h1>
      <aside>A couple of years ago I was reading <a
          href="https://www.amazon.com/Masters-Doom-Created-Transformed-Culture/dp/0812972155"
          title="Amazon link to Masters of Doom">Masters of Doom</a>, and
        something that really struck me was how programmer John
        Carmack used to keep track of his daily work: <code>.plan</code> files.
        Now, there are a lot of resources online covering what
        <code>.plan</code> files are, how to <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_protocol"
          title="Wikipedia page about the finger protocol">access them</a>, or
        even <a href="https://garbagecollected.org/2017/10/24/the-carmack-plan/"
          title="Article about John Carmack's .plan">what John Carmack's
          .plan file looked like</a>, so I am not going to talk about that; what
        I am going to talk about is how I started using <code>.plan</code> files
        and the workflow that I have developed around them.  Before that though,
        let me first spend a few words on the reasons why I think people should
        start using <code>.plan</code> files again (or at least, similar
        solutions).</aside>
    </header>

    <h2>Why</h2>

    <p>First things first, it's simple: a plaintext file, few syntax rules,
    public availability, and that's it.</p>

    <p>Second, keeping my <code>.plan</code> file up to date helps me staying
    <em>organized</em>.  Did you bump into something you want to fix, but
    don't have the time to do it now?  Add an entry for it.  Did you find an
    interesting article to read...<em>later</em>?  Add it to your
    <code>.plan</code> file.  Did you spend a lot of time debugging a problem?
    Write about it, so that you can come back to it later, should something
    similar happen again.  It's like your digital, personal
    <em>journal</em>.</p>

    <p>Lastly, keeping up with your <code>.plan</code> file is going to help
    improving your technical writing skills, and especially if you work in the
    same industry as I do, you know how important that is (e.g. document things,
    file clear and descriptive bug reports, or describe solutions to technical
    challenges).</p>

    <h2>Format</h2>

    <p>The format of my <code>.plan</code> files is pretty basic: mostly
    based on John Carmack's early <code>.plan</code> files, with just a bit of
    <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" title="Original
      Markdown specification">Markdown</a> flavour in it.</p>

    <p>Usually the first few lines of all my <code>.plan</code> files will tell
    you <em>what</em> the file is about, and give a bit of an overview of
    <em>how</em> the file itself is structured.  For example:</p>

    <pre><code>This is my .plan file ...

When I accomplish something, I write a * line on that day.  Whenever a bug
/ missing feature / idea is mentioned during the day and I don't fix it, I make
a note of it and mark it with ?.  Some things get noted many times before they
get fixed.  Occasionally I go back through the old notes and mark with a + the
things I have since fixed, and with a ~ the things I have since lost interest
in.

Sometimes I rant about broken things (mostly, computer related), and how I go
about and (try to) fix them.

    <p>The careful reader might notice that this welcome message is very similar
    (90% similar) to what John Carmack had in his <code>.plan</code> file back
    in the 90s; just a few tweaks , to make the file a bit more Markdown
    friendly (<code>~</code> instead of <code>-</code> for things that I have no
    more interest in, or prefixing my todos with <code>?</code>).  I don't
    explicitly tell how <em>day entries</em> are implemented but at least the
    reader knows there will be some (and it should be pretty straightforward to
    understand the structure, once they go through the file).</p>

    <p>Speaking of <em>day entries</em>, in my <code>.plan</code> those are
    implemented as Markdown's sections headers (with the specific date in
    it), and anything that happened on that day will go right below it:</p>

    <pre><code># 2020-05-12
Did a little bit of debugging as to why **all** my Common Lisp Windows
executables were not printing things out on the stdout as expected, and it seems
to have something to do with redirection...
...

# 2020-05-16
Alright, I think I figured out what I had to do in order to get my CL programs,
on Window, to properly output stuff to stdout.  It turns out you have to
explicitly tell deploy[1], the system I use do deploy standalone CL
applications, that you want your Windows application to be a _console_
application, or otherwise deploy will go with a GUI application (and GUI
applications that don't usually get a standard output to write to).
...</code></pre>

    <p>And if for a given day entry I end up writing about completely unrelated
    topics, I would simply stick a <code>---</code> separator in between, and
    create two or more <em>sub-entries</em>:</p>

Run into another problem with Travis-CI the other day; when deploying artifacts
to GitHub, it would error out with the following message:

    /home/travis/.travis/functions: eval: line 109: unexpected EOF while looking for matching ``'
    /home/travis/.travis/functions: eval: line 110: syntax error: unexpected end of file
...</code></pre>

    <p>And that's pretty much all you need to know to <em>process</em> my
    <code>.plan</code> file; knowing a little bit of Markdown would not hurt
    (e.g. emphasis, strong, code, links), but Markdown is simple enough that you
    can figure things out as you read it.</p>

    <h2>Personal setup</h2>

    <p>I don't have a single <code>.plan</code> file, but multiple of them.  My
    <em>personal</em> one for example (also publicly available <a href="./.plan"
      title="My personal .plan file">here</a>), is where I write about things
    that I have to get done (or have already gotten done), projects I started
    working on, ideas, or computer-related problems I am dealing with (and their
    solutions once I figure them out).  Then I have another <code>.plan</code>
    file that I use at work: very similar to my personal one, but all about
    work-related stuff.  At work, I also keep different <code>.plan</code> files
    one per each person working in my team and reporting to me, and mostly use
    these for 1-1s minutes, or for big achievements / projects that these people
    completed throughout the years.</p>

    <p>All my <code>.plan</code> files live in Dropbox, and since I have Dropbox
    installed on all the PCs I care about (even on my mobile phone), I can edit
    all my <code>.plan</code> files from everywhere.  Of course you don't have
    to use Dropbox, but I just find it too convenient for <em>not</em> using it:
    edit your <code>.plan</code> file while on the go, hit save, and when you
    get back to your PC the added content will be there; or the other way
    around, you shut down your PC, hop on a train, you open Dropbox on your
    mobile, and a few seconds later you can continue working from where you left
    off before.  Of course I don't have this urge of editing my
    <code>.plan</code> file every time I am on the go, but if I have to, I can
    do it.</p>

    <p>Talking about editing <code>.plan</code> files... I use Vim as text
    editor, and if you do too here are a few tips / hacks to make
    "<code>.plan</code> files editing", even more enjoyable:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>A <a
        href="https://github.com/iamFIREcracker/dotfiles/blob/master/.vim/syntax/plan.vim"
        title="Vim syntax file for .plan files">syntax</a> file to color basic
      things like day entries, todos, emphasis, strong, links, and code (to be
      placed at <code>~/.vim/syntax/plan.vim</code>)</li>
      <li>A <a
        href="https://github.com/iamFIREcracker/dotfiles/blob/master/.vim/ftplugin/plan/folding.vim"
        title="Vim folding file for .plan files">folding</a> file to create
      folds for day entries (to be placed at
      <code>~/.vim/ftplugin/plan/folding.vim</code>)</li>
      <li>An <code>autocmd</code> group to create mappings for creating new day
      entries without specifying the current date, or to automatically populate
      the <code>quickfix</code> with all the todos listed in the
      <code>.plan</code> file being edited:

        <pre><code>augroup ft_plan
    au!

    au FileType plan setlocal wrap textwidth=0
    au FileType plan nnoremap &lt;localleader&gt;n Go&lt;cr&gt;# &lt;C-R&gt;=strftime("%Y-%m-%d")&lt;CR&gt;&lt;CR&gt;&lt;BS&gt;&lt;BS&gt;
    au FileType plan nnoremap &lt;localleader&gt;o :silent lgrep '^\?' %&lt;cr&gt;:lopen&lt;cr&gt;:redraw!&lt;cr&gt;
augroup END</code></pre>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Lastly, I have a <code>cron(8)</code> job on my server, that every night
    downloads my <code>.plan</code> and places it into a specific folder so that
    my web server can <em>serve</em> it.  I also wrote a small program, <a
      href="https://github.com/iamFIREcracker/plan-rss" title="GitHub page of
      plan-rss, a .plan file to RSS feed converter">plan-rss</a>, that my server
    automatically runs to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS"
    title="Wikipedia page about RSS">RSS</a> feed of all the most recent
    day entries of my <code>.plan</code> file (it's not perfect, but if you are
    looking for a way to stay up to date with my <code>.plan</code> file, then
    subscribing to my <a type="application/rss+xml" href="./plan.xml" title="My
      personal .plan file, as a RSS feed feed">plan.xml</a> is probably your
    best bet).</p>

    <h2>Closing thoughts</h2>

    <p>That's pretty much all I had to say about <code>.plan</code> files, and
    if anything, I hope I made you at least a little bit curious about the
    idea behind them.</p>

    <p>Remember: it does not matter which syntax rules you end up using, which
    editor you will be typing these notes in, or which mark-up language rules
    you will ultimately end up supporting.  What really matters is that you
    start writing, and start taking notes... and more importantly, that you do
    this <em>consistently</em>: the more you do it, the more natural it will
    feel, and the more <em>weird</em> it will feel to get at the end of the day,
    after having spent so many hours in front of your PC, without having
    created an entry in your <code>.plan</code> file.</p>

    <p>Happy <code>.plan</code>-ing</p>
