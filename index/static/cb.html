      <aside>Yet another tool to wrap reads from, and writes to the OS clipboard -- it works from within SSH sessions too!</aside>
    </header>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
    My life as a developer is a mess: at work I have a laptop with Windows 7 and Cygwin installed; I also have a Vagrant box, running Ubuntu, that I use to do the most of my development work.  At home I have a Macbook Air, with Mac OS Sierra.
    </p>

    <p>
    You can easily imagine how quickly I got tired of having to remember which of the various <code>pbaste</code>, <code>getclip</code> et al.  command I should have run depending on which terminal window I had opened.
    </p>

    <p>
    Wouldn't it be nice if I could read from the OS clipboard, or write to it, using a single command line tool? And wouldn't it awesome if the same tool worked on various operating systems? (at least the ones I use on a daily basis)
    </p>

    <p>
    <em>enters <code>cb</code>..</em>
    </p>

    <h2>Hands-on</h2>
    <span>Write to the OS clipboard</span>
    <pre>
      <code>
&gt; echo "cb is awesome!" | cowsay | cb
      </code>
    </pre>
    <span>Read from the OS clipboard</span>
    <pre>
      <code>
&gt; cb

    <span>It works remotely too!</span>
    <pre>
      <code>
&gt; cb --listen &amp;
